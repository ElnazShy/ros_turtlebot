	- Everything in /code/src

Learn how to make a custom world. DONE. 
	- See /code/src/turtlebot_gazebo/worlds/custom_corridorV1.world DONE.
	- How to make a custom world in stage. TODO

Make simple movements open loop. DONE
	- See /code/turtlebot_gazebo/scripts/objective1

Make a simple movement template based on a closed loop. DONE
	- Use Actionlib to enforce a goal oriented server-client architecture. DONE
	- See motor encoders for more eact movements. TODO

Implement FSMs using http://wiki.ros.org/smach. TODO
	- Make a model from Dr. Fu's code first. TODO
	- Choose Datastructure. TODO

Low Priority
------------
Finish the Getting Started with ROS Part 2 documentation.

Make a single .launch file to start everything from gazebo, actionlib server, navigation stack, rviz and tf. 


Doubts: 
=======

Get the current architecture evaluated. 
	- Decide on SLAM or simple FSMs
	- Dr. Fu's code implementation still seeing.
